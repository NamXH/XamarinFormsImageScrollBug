XamarinFormsImageScrollBug
==========================
Run this minimal project. Scroll up and down a few times. The image will appear on the last TextCell.

Only these files are modified/added: App.cs, MyPage.xaml, MyPage.xaml.cs, Images/contact_icon.png. All other files are generated by Xamarin Form Blank Project template.
